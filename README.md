# ðŸŽ¯ Customer Segmentation Analysis

## Project Overview
The Customer Segmentation Analysis project uses clustering and machine learning techniques to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior, demographics, and other relevant features. By identifying distinct customer groups, this project aims to support targeted marketing strategies, improve customer engagement, and optimize business decision-making.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Automated data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualization of key customer metrics and behavior patterns.
- **Clustering Algorithms:** Implementation of various clustering techniques (e.g., K-Means) to identify customer segments.
- **Model Evaluation:** Use of silhouette scores and other metrics to assess the quality of clusters.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Streamlit-based web application to explore segmentation results in real time.
- **Insights & Recommendations:** Actionable insights to tailor marketing campaigns and improve customer retention.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering)
- **Web Application:** Streamlit
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub
